## Data Files

Data for this project was collected by recording myoelectric signals (MESs) over 10 second time intervals using a Measurement Computing USB-1608FS-Plus DAQ card.
Data was recorded for seven different gestures:
- **null** (no movement)
- **fist** open and close
- **thumb** open and close
- **index** open and close
- **middle** open and close
- **ring** open and close
- **pinkie** open and close

The data was recorded for 2 different users and each user recorded signals for each gesture 50 times. 

### Files

- `user1_OutputData.npz` : data from user one
- `user2_OutputData.npz` : data from user two
- `combinedOutputData.npz` : combined data of user one and two




**Future Work** Increase data and number of users.
