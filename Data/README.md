## Data Files

Data for this project was collected by recording myoelectric signals (MESs) over 10 second time intervals using a Measurement Computing USB-1608FS-Plus DAQ card.
Data was recorded for seven different gestures. Gestures and their labels are shown below.

**Gestures** | **Label**
-------------------|----------------------
**null** (no movement) | 0 
**fist** open and close | 1
**thumb** open and close | 2
**index** open and close | 3
**middle** open and close | 4
**ring** open and close | 5
**pinkie** open and close | 6

The data was recorded for 2 different users and each user recorded signals for each gesture 50 times. 

### Files

- `user1_OutputData.npz` : data from user one
- `user2_OutputData.npz` : data from user two
- `combinedOutputData.npz` : combined data of user one and two




**Future Work** Increase data and number of users.
