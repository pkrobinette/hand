## Usage
1. `combinedFeatureExtraction.py`  *Used in research 19/20*
The first file that you will use is combined feature extraction. This file
is used to extract specific features from the raw MESs (Myoelectric Signals) taken from the DAQ.
To use this file, place the file path of the raw data into the variable PATH.
Place the file path of where you want the extracted features to populate in PATH2
and pick a name for the new file in the following line.


1. `seperateFeatureExtraction.py` *Not yet used*
This file is similar to combinedFeatureExtraction.py except that it places each
feature into a separate file instead of a combined file. 
To use this file, place the file path of the raw data into the variable PATH.
Place the file path of where you want the extracted features to populate in PATH2.


1. `Algorithms5_13.py`
This file runs several algorithms on the data created in
`combinedFeatureExtraction.py`.
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K Nearest Neighbor
- KMeans Cluster

To use this file, place the file of the extracted features into the variable
PATH2.
